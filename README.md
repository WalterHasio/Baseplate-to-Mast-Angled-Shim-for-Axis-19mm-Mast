Angled mast shim for changing the angle between the mast and baseplate with a 19mm Axis aluminum mast.  The part goes inside the baseplate, and between the baseplate and the mast extrusion.  This is an alternative to using a baseplate shim between the baseplate and board.

With the parts I have, the amount of angle adjustment is limited to about 1.5 degrees, there may be some variation so check before attempting to use this shim.

When shimming near the board, keep in mind that the angle adjusts the foil position forwards and backwards.  For each degree of angle, the foil will shift forwards or backwards about half an inch on a 75cm mast (more with longer masts).  This effectively shifts the usable range of the tracks in the board. 

Shims and Adapters
This is a list of various shims and adapters I've designed for foiling, most are available on Thingiverse, but a few are for sale.

Baseplate to Mast Angled Shim - Adjusts the angle of the board to the mast.  This does the same thing as a baseplate shim, but it goes inside the baseplate. Axis 19mm version

Baseplate to Mast Flat Shim - Fills the gap between the baseplate and the sides of the mast extrusion to make the system slighty more rigid. Axis 19mm version

Surf Elementals Mast Adapter - Adapter to use the more rigid 19mm Axis aluminum masts with Takuma foils. Axis 19mm Mast to Takuma Fuselage version

Mast to Fuselage Angled Shim - Adjusts the angle between the mast and the fuselage.  It's similar in function to a baseplate shim, but it goes inside the fuselage.  Takuma version - aluminum Takuma version - printable
